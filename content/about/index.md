I like to take photos, and get it right first time, in camera. So, I use [Lightroom](https://lightroom.adobe.com/) to catalogue, process and output. I also like to make this website. It is opensource where I can find a good, easy way to do it. If you can tell me of a more open way of doing it I'm interested. The content is written in markdown, compiled by Hugo, controlled by git, hosted by github pages. Both he development and compiled repositories are freely accessible on github.
